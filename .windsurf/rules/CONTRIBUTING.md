# Contributing Guidelines

## ✅ PR Requirements
- Keep PRs under **300 lines** where possible
- PRs must be linked to an issue or clearly explain purpose
- PR titles use **Conventional Commits** format:
  - `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, etc.
- Assign appropriate reviewers
- Use labels: `feature`, `bug`, `tech-debt`, `urgent`, etc.

## 🔍 Code Style
- Use Prettier and ESLint to auto-format before push
- Follow project-specific TypeScript/React conventions

## 📄 Documentation
- Update `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` if relevant
- Document any new environment variables in `.env.example`

## ⏳ Review Flow
1. Create draft PR early if needed
2. Request review from at least one team member
3. Resolve all comments before merge
4. Merge only when all required checks pass
